# Bob Graham Round: Instructions for Supporters

This is an amended version of the instructions pdf I shared on Whatsapp. By using md files and git it makes seeing changes easier :), without the bloat of tex.

## Round Details

Thank you for helping with my Bob Graham Round attempt. 
This wouldn't be possible without you all giving up time to give me a hand, and it's really appreciated, so thank you very much. Hopefully I can deliver. 
I'm really humbled by the number of people who are willing to give up their time to help me out with my big run ambitions.

The aims of the day, in priority order, are:

1. Have a fun, big day out in the hills with my mates.
1. Finish.
1. Finish under 24 hours.


I have pencilled in the weekend of the 6th-8th June 2025 as the going date. The rough plan is to leave Keswick early evening ($\sim$6 pm) on the Friday (6th). The idea is to come off Blencathra before dark, and get to Bowfell by the time it's got light.
 

## Round Logistics

### Support crew duties
Those of you who've supported big runs before will have an idea of what is entailed in supporting an attempt. The $\sim$66 mile route is typically split up into five legs, beginning and ending at locations where the route crosses roads. Supporters are generally grouped into two categories:

- Run support: running a leg of the route with me, "witnessing" the summits for club ratification, and carrying my kit, food and water for me.
- Roadside support: ferrying run supporters to/from their legs, providing food and water replenishment (suncream?) and a bit of kit for me to change if needed (like spare t-shirt, socks or a change of shoes). This might also involve making me a brew or some porridge or something ready.


### Running Logistics

I'd like two running supporters per leg ideally (three would be super though), with one person designated as navigator, responsible for making sure that we hit the right summits, in the right order without going too far astray in the process. Do chip in though if you're not the navigator. 

By all means let's have a good gang of us if enough folk want to help, but I'd prefer more than one supporter per leg if at all possible, to spread the supporter load. If you're not sure if you'll be fast enough (you are), then opt for a later leg (4 or 5) when I'll be crocked. Similarly, I don't want too much of a gaggle as I'm aware how eroded parts of the Lakes and the Bob Graham route are (particularly Leg 1 and 2) and I don't want to contribute too much to this continued erosion. Apparently the Newlands Memorial race didn't used to have to advise people from not using the Bob Graham trod, because there wasn't one. 

Don't worry about noting down times of witnessing summits for verification purposes while en-route: we'll worry about that later, with the help of Strava or other similar run-tracking software.

#### Navigation
I'll provide a gpx of my preferred route that I've recced in full and based on my preferences. I'll also circulate a rough schedule for the time I want (probably around 22 hours but I want to finish the thing rather than setting off too quick and then pulling out at Wasdale at the 15 hour mark). See Section \ref{sec:schedule}. 

Everything else will be pretty standard. Unless you know better and you think I'll end up agreeing that you know better, please trust the route and gpx I'll circulate. I'll have my Harveys map in my rucksack that support will carry: up to you if you want to use it or not.

#### Kit

I don't plan to carry any kit save maybe a small bumbag with a tracker in, instead relying on my trusty supporters. I'll have a rucksack for one of you to carry (probably my trusty smelly 25 litre OMM bag) which will have, as a minimum the following kit in a drybag:

- Jacket and Trousers
- Wooly hat
- Sunhat and glasses
- Spare layers (long sleeved top, long bottoms etc)
- Gloves
- Survival Bag

In addition, I'd like it if you could shove my food and drink in there too. Please have my food and drink somewhere accessible on the way around. Little and often is the mantra: every half hour at the maximum: ideally every twenty minutes. Let's aim to eat as much real food until Dunmail and then whatever I can keep down after that. Same with water (including electrolytes). I want to be weeing and pooing please. Navigators should be familiar with where reliable water is. If in doubt, more water will need to be carried. In general I'm not too fussed about drinking out of becks (within reason), you may be different.


By all means chuck your own gear in amongst mine!

Please make sure you carry enough kit to keep you warm and happy during the round too. Weather and conditions can change quickly so let's not become a liability.

### Road support logistics
Thank you for agreeing to help at a changeover, for all its trouble and lack of being able to go on the hill with me, you are a vital part of the round, so thank you again. Only one (Dunmail Raise) is planned to be at a really unsociable hour. Hopefully there'll be enough folk about to divvy up the logistics between different people to save loads of driving.

There are five locations where I'd like road support to meet me, by the sounds of things there ought to be enough folk about to keep things simple and not too taxing so the same people aren't going to every road crossing (unless you really want to!). 

For reference, Threlkeld will be about 9:30 pm; Dunmail Raise 2 am; Wasdale 8 am; Honister 1 pm and Newlands Church 3 pm.

#### Generic road support instructions
I'll be a bit done in, and even more so as the day continues. I don't plan to stop at long at each changeover point, maybe enough to change socks and shoes if necessary and grab some food. But I'm planning on eating on the move rather than stopping for a long time to get sad and pull out.  Please have shoes, socks, extra layers, suncream, painkillers, vaseline handy. I will supply all these!

Food will be in labelled bags for each changeover with that changeover's name on it, with one to eat at/leaving the changeover, and another to give to the supporters for the subsequent leg for them to carry.

Time can disappear quickly at changeovers so do enforce the time limits on the spreadsheet. You have my permission to do whatever it takes to tell me to stop moaning and to get a move on once the allotted time is up (or earlier). Don't let me hang around for the sake of it. 

Do not let me quit in camp unless my leg is hanging off. Make sure I get up the next hill before deciding to quit.

Binoculars might be handy to spot me coming off the hill, particularly where phone signal is patchy (I plan to hire a tracker but you need phone signal to use the website). Phone signal is poor in Wasdale and I'd be surprised if it's reliable at Newlands Church (it is not reliable). It is generally ok at Threlkeld and Dunmail Raise. Honister is probably ok too.
I have bought a set of binoculars, so will probably put them in the Wasdale road support kit.

## Supporter arrangements
I'm happy to book some accommodation in the Keswick area for you all to relax in (will probs be a campsite). By all means do your own thing, especially if you're on a Wasdale leg. Wasdale supporters might choose to jog over from Honister or Seatoller if they wish to. Or if you're blessed with a van. 
I'm having a bit of trouble tracking down a campsite, please bear with me. You might have to do your own thing, sorry.

Chez Coney in Oxenholme is available too: 1 double bed, 1 double sofa bed, 1 single sofa bed plus floor space.

If you're parking in a National Trust car park (Wasdale, Honister), feel free to use my National Trust membership card to get you parking. If you end up paying for parking anywhere, let me know and I will pay you back!!

### Food \& Drink

#### Leg food
As mentioned above, food every twenty minutes while on the move.
Each leg's food will be split into sweet and savoury, with a focus on more real food towards the start and getting more weird as the day drags on.

Sweet food will be jelly babies, flapjack and similar.
Savoury will likely be nuts and spuds. It could well be that by leg 3 that my stomach has thrown a wobbly and I won't keep much down, so what I can get down early on during the round will be crucial.

#### Water
I don't tend to drink enough when running, despite being a sweaty boy. This is bad and the round will end badly if I do this on the attempt.

Hence I need you to water me appropriately on the day. Weeing and pooing please. Electrolyte tabs will be available. I'm fairly blas\'{e} about drinking from the becks where possible as long as they're high, flowing and clear enough. And it saves supporters carrying excess water. It's a fine balance though and I'm keen to err on the side of carrying too much than not enough. After all, I'm not carrying it, you are.
Given how little rain we've had, I could well err on the side of caution here.


## Rough schedule
I will circulate a rough 22 hour schedule I've adapted closer to the time. Don't get too downhearted on the odd minute lost here and there: it's for reference. I picked 22 hours so that the event of losing half an hour or an hour in total over the round still means a sub 24 completion.
Particularly on Leg 3. Don't fret.
