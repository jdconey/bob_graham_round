# Food & Drink

> The rule of thumb is food every twenty minutes to half an hour, and to average 200 calories of food per hour on the hill, plus bits at road support locations.

## Hill food
- Salty: cashew nuts, potato, butties
- Sweeter: jelly babies, tunnocks, flapjack

### Calories per thing
| Foodstuff | Calories |
|-----------|----------|
|Cashew nuts| 622 per 100g|
|Potato| ? |
|Butties| ? |
|Flapjack| ~450 per 100g|
| Jelly babies| 341 per 100g|

### Legs
|Leg no.| Calories       | Water           | Fill up options|
|-------|--------------- |-----------------|----------------|
| Leg 1 | 800 calories   | 1.5 litres      |Wiley Gill|
| Leg 2 | 1000 calories  | 2.5 litres      |Not much till Grisedale Tarn|
| Leg 3 | 1200 calories  | 2.5 litres      | Mere Gill; Stake Gill| 
| Leg 4 | 1000 calories  | 2.5 litres (more if hot)| Black Sail Pass; Beck Head|
| Leg 5 | 600 calories   | 1.5 litres      | Scope Beck; Newlands road support|

### Water carrying devices
- OMM 500 ml -> leg 1
- OMM 750 ml 
- 2x Kalenji 500 ml soft flasks (1 to go in bumbag, other to be carried & swapped)
- 2x UD 500 ml soft flasks
- Kalenji bladder 1 l
- Decathlon 950 ml
- SIS 1l


Leg 1 > 2x Kalenji soft flasks & OMM 500 ml (1.5 litres)
Leg 2 > As leg 1, top up at Threlkeld and add in Decathlon 1l bottle (2.5 litres)
Leg 3 > As leg 2
Leg 4 > As leg 3
Leg 5 > 1.5 litres: soft flasks & omm bottle

#### Road support:
- Threlkeld: SIS bottle and Decathlon bottle (taken on leg). 
- Dunmail: SIS bottle from Threlkeld support & spare UD soft flask. 
- Wasdale: OMM 750 ml, Kalenji bladder & spare UD soft flask. Porridge and a cup of tea.
- Honister: SIS bottle


All road support to have big bottle of water for re-filling. I have three (five litre) ones:
Wasdale to take one
Ideally share Threlkeld and Dunmail (top up at campsite?)

Own brand Coke has insufficient sugar (about half the branded one, and the other one has less too) so I've got three bottles of full fat branded one (live life on the edge, eh).
Wasdale will have one, and I'll share the other two between Threlkeld & Dunmail, and Honister and Newlands.
